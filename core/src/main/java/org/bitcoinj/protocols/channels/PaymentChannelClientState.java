/**
 * <p>A payment channel is a method of sending money to someone such that the amount of money you send can be adjusted
 * after the fact, in an efficient manner that does not require broadcasting to the network. This can be used to
 * implement micropayments or other payment schemes in which immediate settlement is not required, but zero trust
 * negotiation is. Note that this class only allows the amount of money sent to be incremented, not decremented.</p>
 *
 * <p>This class has two subclasses, {@link PaymentChannelV1ClientState} and {@link PaymentChannelV2ClientState} for
 * protocols version 1 and 2.</p>
 *
 * <p>This class implements the core state machine for the client side of the protocol. The server side is implemented
 * by {@link PaymentChannelServerState} and {@link PaymentChannelClientConnection} implements a network protocol
 * suitable for TCP/IP connections which moves this class through each state. We say that the party who is sending funds
 * is the <i>client</i> or <i>initiating party</i>. The party that is receiving the funds is the <i>server</i> or
 * <i>receiving party</i>. Although the underlying Bitcoin protocol is capable of more complex relationships than that,
 * this class implements only the simplest case.</p>
 *
 * <p>A channel has an expiry parameter. If the server halts after the multi-signature contract which locks
 * up the given value is broadcast you
