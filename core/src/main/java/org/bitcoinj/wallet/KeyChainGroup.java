/**
 * <p>A KeyChainGroup is used by the {@link org.bitcoinj.wallet.Wallet} and
 * manages: a {@link BasicKeyChain} object (which will normally be empty), and zero or more
 * {@link DeterministicKeyChain}s. A deterministic key chain will be created lazily/on demand
 * when a fresh or current key is requested, possibly being initialized from the private key bytes of the earliest non
 * rotating key in the basic key chain if one is available, or from a fresh random seed if not.</p>
 *
 * <p>If a key rotation time is set, it may be necessary to add a new DeterministicKeyChain with a fresh seed
 * and also preserve the old one, so funds can be swept from the rotating keys. In this case, there may be
 * more than one deterministic chain. The latest chain is called the active chain and is where new keys are served
 * from.</p>
 *
 * <p>The wallet delegates most key management tasks to this class. It is <b>not</b> thread safe and requires external
 * locking, i.e. by the wallet lock. The group then in turn delegates most operations to the key chain objects,
 * combining their responses together when necessary.</p>
 *
 * <p>Deterministic key chains have a concept of a lookahead size and threshold. Please see the discussion in the
 * class docs for {@link DeterministicKeyChain} for more information on this topic.</p>
