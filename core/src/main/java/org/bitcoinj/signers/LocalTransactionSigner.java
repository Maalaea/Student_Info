/**
 * <p>{@link TransactionSigner} implementation for signing inputs using keys from provided {@link org.bitcoinj.wallet.KeyBag}.</p>
 * <p>This signer doesn't create input scripts for tx inputs. Instead it expects inputs to contain scripts with
 * empty sigs and replaces one of the empty sigs with calculated signature.
 * </p>
 * <p>This signer is always implicitly added into every wallet and it is the first signer to be executed during tx
 * completion. As the first signer to create a signature, it stores derivation path of the signing key in a given
 * {@link ProposedTransaction} object that will be also passed then to the next signer in chain. This allows other
 * signers to use correct signing key for P2SH inputs, because all the keys involved in a single P2SH address have
 * the same derivation path.</p>
 * <p>This signer always uses {@link org.bitcoinj.core.Transaction.SigHash#ALL} signing mode.</p>
