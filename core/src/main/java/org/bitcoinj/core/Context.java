// TODO: Finish adding Context c'tors to all the different objects so we can start deprecating the versions that take NetworkParameters.
// TODO: Add a working directory notion to Context and make various subsystems that want to use files default to that directory (eg. Orchid, block stores, wallet, etc).
// TODO: Auto-register the block chain object here, and then use it in the (newly deprecated) TransactionConfidence.getDepthInBlocks() method: the new version should take an AbstractBlockChain specifically.
//       Also use the block chain object reference from the context in PeerGroup and remove the other constructors, as it's easy to forget to wire things up.
// TODO: Move Threading.USER_THREAD to here and leave behind just a source code stub.
